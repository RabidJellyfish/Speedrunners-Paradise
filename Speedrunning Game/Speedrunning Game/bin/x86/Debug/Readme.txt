== Downloading levels ==
In the level select screen in game, use the left/right arrow keys to select categories. Select the "Download" tab to show available levels for download. You can press 'S' to search by level name or by author (not both at once) and 'D' to change how the levels are sorted. Press Enter to download a level. When a level is downloaded, it will be available in the "custom" tab in the level select. Press the "Delete" key to remove a level from your custom levels list. It will be deleted permanently from your computer but you can always redownload the level.

== Disclaimer ==
This game's leaderboards and downloadable levels are running on a free server, so there will most likely be unplanned down time. There is nothing I can do about it, so sorry.

Enjoy the game!
